# TouchWood Hiring
TouchWood Hiring aims to transform the hiring experience by leveraging modern AI capabilities—including LLMs, automated reasoning, and agentic workflows—to streamline the evaluation of resumes against job descriptions, and to automate intelligent candidate engagement. 

takes as input the candidate's resume, location, and the job description (in PDF format), and uses AI models to classify profiles based on their compatibility with the role: Strong Match, Medium Match, or Weak Match. For non-strong matches, the system goes one step further—generating personalized follow-up questions to extract missing or clarifying information, suggesting whether it's worth reaching out to the candidate. 

Other important features includes: 
* Flexibility to add Agentic AI based modules to initiate voice calls and autonomously follow up with candidates. 
* It can draft tailored email communications to be sent to candidates 
* UI to select bulk resumes and JDs. 
* Schedule tasks using serverless solutions
* Set reminders
